# ROS2 Semantic Contract

Gaussian-LIC and Coco-LIC use message time as part of the estimator state, not just
as metadata. This file records the ROS2 behavior that must stay fixed while the
paper-level CUDA mapper and continuous-time frontend are being ported.

## Time Math

- Algorithmic time deltas and sync windows use signed `int64_t` nanoseconds.
- `rclcpp::Time` and double seconds are allowed only at ROS API or log boundaries.
- Zero and negative builtin stamps are preserved as numeric nanoseconds. They are
  not normalized through ROS clocks before B-spline, IMU, LiDAR deskew, or frame
  synchronization math.
- Local builtin-stamp helpers reject invalid ROS2 stamps with `nanosec >= 1e9`
  before arithmetic, so malformed messages fail at the input boundary instead of
  shifting synchronization, IMU integration, or deskew intervals silently.
- `mapping_node` keeps `sync_tolerance_sec` as the public parameter for profile
  compatibility, then converts it once to `sync_tolerance_nsec_`.
- `lic2_contract_adapter` IMU fallback integrates with nanosecond stamp deltas
  and rejects non-positive or over-limit intervals.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking/tracking_node` publishes the latest image, LiDAR, and
  IMU stamps as signed nanoseconds on `/gaussian_lic/frontend/status`; the
  native tracking smoke gate requires those fields to be nonzero.
- Native tracking rejects non-monotonic image, depth, rendered-image, LiDAR, and
  IMU stream stamps before mutating the estimator. Image/depth/rendered streams
  may repeat a stamp, while LiDAR and IMU must be strictly increasing.
- Native tracking also rejects non-finite IMU angular velocity or acceleration
  before propagation/preintegration and publishes an invalid-measurement counter.
- IMU callbacks must propagate the current IMU sample and append it to the
  sliding-window preintegrator before releasing any point clouds that were waiting
  for that sample. Releasing the queue first recreates a ROS2 callback-order race:
  the LiDAR frame uses the previous IMU span, then strict BA reports a hidden IMU
  time-gap skip.

## QoS

- Sensor streams default to `best_effort`, `keep_last`, depth `5`.
- `mapping_node` exposes per-input overrides for point cloud, pose, image,
  camera info, depth, and IMU QoS. Each stream falls back to `sensor_qos_*`, so
  high-rate image/LiDAR can remain bounded `best_effort` while controlled replay
  or low-rate keyframe/control topics can be promoted independently to
  `reliable` without forcing reliable delivery onto every sensor stream.
- `lic2_contract_adapter` exposes the same fallback pattern separately for raw
  inputs and mapper-contract outputs, so adapter publisher QoS can be matched to
  mapper subscriber QoS when a replay profile promotes selected low-rate streams
  to `reliable`.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking/tracking.launch.py` exposes `sensor_qos_reliability`,
  `sensor_qos_history`, and `sensor_qos_depth`, plus per-stream raw-input and
  mapper-output QoS overrides. Raw image, CameraInfo, depth, LiDAR, and IMU
  subscriptions, and image, CameraInfo, depth, point cloud, pose, and frontend
  odometry publishers each fall back to the global defaults instead of sharing a
  hard-coded policy.
- High-rate image, LiDAR, IMU, and depth topics should stay volatile and bounded.
- Visual and SE3 photometric BA samples use bounded mapper-render/depth caches
  and nearest-stamp selection inside `visual_factor_max_dt_ns`, so rosbag2 topic
  arrival order cannot silently pair an image with an old render or depth frame.
- Delayed visual-alignment and SE3 photometric BA factors use bounded pending
  queues instead of single-slot "latest" storage. This preserves multiple valid
  mapper-feedback factors under asynchronous image/render arrival while still
  surfacing queue overflow or freshness expiry through stale-drop counters.
- Reliable QoS is opt-in for controlled local rosbag2 replay or drivers known to
  publish reliable sensor streams.
- State and visualization outputs that are naturally latched, such as path and
  Gaussian map chunks, can use reliable transient-local QoS.

## Executor

- Strict replay and composition use the single-threaded `component_container`.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking/tracking_node` defaults `serialize_callbacks:=true`.
  All raw image, camera-info, depth, LiDAR, IMU, rendered-image, and Gaussian-map
  callbacks pass through one mutex before mutating estimator state, so a launch
  that swaps to `MultiThreadedExecutor` cannot concurrently update IMU
  propagation, deskew, visual factors, and the sliding window.
- The continuous-time frontend must not rely on callback interleaving from a
  `MultiThreadedExecutor`. If higher throughput is needed later, callbacks must
  push messages into deterministic stamp-ordered queues before estimator updates.

## tf2

- Strict estimator math must not depend on implicit `tf2` lookup interpolation,
  timeout, or cache behavior.
- Current nodes only broadcast TF from already selected poses. A future tracker
  may consume static extrinsics from configuration, but any time-varying transform
  used for math needs an explicit stamped buffer and an upstream-parity test.

## Rosbag Replay

- Launch replay uses `ros2 bag play ... --clock --read-ahead-queue-size 100`
  and `use_sim_time:=true`. The queue stays bounded for deterministic pressure
  while still large enough for Jazzy rosbag2 to deliver mixed high-rate sensor
  topics.
- Strict current collection replays finite datasets without `--loop` by default,
  waits for playback completion, then keeps the mapper alive for a configurable
  settle window before saving outputs. `--loop-playback` is reserved for smoke
  and soak tests where repeated frames are intentional.
- Strict baseline comparison still needs the same topic stamps and start order as
  the ROS1 run. If rosbag2 playback ordering is not enough for a target sequence,
  add a deterministic sequential replay helper instead of tuning estimator code.
- `scripts/rosbag2_timing_audit.py` checks `metadata.yaml` plus sqlite3 `.db3`
  message timestamp ordering and required topic counts before a replay is used
  as baseline evidence. MCAP bags are reported as metadata-only unless an MCAP
  parser is available in the local environment.
- `scripts/fastlivo2_ros1_to_frontend_raw.py` writes converted rosbag2 messages
  through a stable header-stamp sort buffer (`--sort-buffer-sec`, default 5s) so
  ROS1 bag connection ordering does not leak timestamp regressions into rosbag2
  playback.
- `scripts/convert_ros1_bag_to_rosbag2.py` runs the timing audit after generic
  ROS1-to-rosbag2 conversion unless `--skip-timing-audit` is explicitly used.
- `scripts/strict_rosbag2_play.sh` wraps audit plus the fixed replay command for
  current-result collection scripts, keeping strict replay options in one place.

## Regression Check

Run:

```bash
./scripts/check_ros2_semantics_contract.py
```

The check fails if timestamp helpers regress to double-second math, mapper
per-input QoS controls disappear, dataset profiles stop using bounded
best-effort sensor QoS, composition defaults back to the multi-threaded
component container, launch replay drops `/clock`, or tf2 lookup consumption is
introduced without a semantic wrapper.
