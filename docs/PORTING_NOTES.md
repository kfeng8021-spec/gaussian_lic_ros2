# Porting Notes

## Project Direction

The port should be native ROS2, not only a ROS1 bridge wrapper. Bridge support can exist as a compatibility path, but the main README and launch flow should target native ROS2 nodes.

## Initial ROS2 Topic Contract

Inputs:

```text
/camera/image          sensor_msgs/msg/Image
/camera/camera_info    sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo
/livox/lidar           sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2
/imu                   sensor_msgs/msg/Imu
/tf                    tf2_msgs/msg/TFMessage
/tf_static             tf2_msgs/msg/TFMessage
```

Outputs:

```text
/gaussian_lic/odometry        nav_msgs/msg/Odometry
/gaussian_lic/path            nav_msgs/msg/Path
/gaussian_lic/map_points      sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2
/gaussian_lic/rendered_image  sensor_msgs/msg/Image
/gaussian_lic/gaussian_map    gaussian_lic_msgs/msg/GaussianArray
/gaussian_lic/status          gaussian_lic_msgs/msg/MappingStatus
```

## ROS2 Design Rules

- Use configurable sensor-data QoS for image, point cloud, pose, camera info, depth, and IMU subscriptions. Defaults are `best_effort`, `keep_last`, depth `5`; `sensor_qos_reliability:=reliable` is available for reliable rosbag2 or driver outputs.
- Use lifecycle nodes for long-running mapping/tracking components.
- Keep GPU/CUDA code isolated from middleware glue.
- `mapping_node` is available as both a standalone executable and an `rclcpp_components` plugin; launch with `use_composition:=true` to load it in `component_container_mt`.
- Keep launch files dataset-agnostic; put dataset paths and remaps in config.

## Known Hard Part

Gaussian-LIC depends on Coco-LIC for tracking, and Coco-LIC is also ROS1. A true port needs to handle both. A bridge-only solution should not be marketed as the main ROS2 port.

## Current Native Slice

`gaussian_lic_mapping/mapping_node` now ports the ROS-facing frame synchronization and frame-conversion surface from upstream Gaussian-LIC. It buffers:

```text
/points_for_gs
/pose_for_gs
/image_for_gs
/camera_info_for_gs
/depth_for_gs
```

and aligns frames using `/points_for_gs` as the reference timestamp with `sync_tolerance_sec` defaulting to `0.01`, matching upstream's 10 ms tolerance. `CameraInfo` is not part of the four-way sync; the latest valid message updates the active `fx/fy/cx/cy` intrinsics, and parameter values remain the fallback.

After alignment, the node converts ROS2 messages into `MapperFrameData`:

```text
Image       -> RGB float32 OpenCV matrix in [0, 1]
CameraInfo  -> active fx/fy/cx/cy intrinsics for torch camera/Gaussian initialization
Depth       -> metric float32 OpenCV matrix
PoseStamped -> Eigen q_wc, t_wc, R_wc
PointCloud2 -> world xyz, RGB color in [0, 1], camera-frame depth
```

PointCloud2 color uses packed `rgb/rgba` or scalar `r/g/b` fields when present. For uncolored clouds, the ROS2 port now projects each positive-depth point into the synchronized image with the active pinhole intrinsics and samples the image color, keeping a white fallback for points outside the image. This preserves the LiDAR-camera color boundary needed by Gaussian initialization without requiring a pre-colored cloud topic.

Converted frames are then accumulated in `MapperDataset`, mirroring the non-torch state of upstream `Dataset`:

```text
train/test camera frame records
R_wc / t_wc pose records
pending world points
pending RGB colors
pending camera-frame depths
```

The native mapper also republishes converted tracking/map-point surfaces:

```text
PoseStamped -> nav_msgs/msg/Odometry on /gaussian_lic/odometry
PoseStamped -> nav_msgs/msg/Path on /gaussian_lic/path
Accumulated MapperPoint world cloud -> sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2 on /gaussian_lic/map_points
render_mode:=debug_cpu CPU projected accumulated map preview -> sensor_msgs/msg/Image on /gaussian_lic/rendered_image
Imu -> native ROS2 subscription/counting for the LIC input contract
PoseStamped -> optional TF map -> camera when publish_tf:=true
```

The CUDA rasterizer, Gaussian optimizer, and Coco-LIC IMU fusion are not ported yet. `/gaussian_lic/rendered_image` currently projects accumulated debug map points back into the current camera with a CPU z-buffer, not the differentiable splat rasterizer. The current torch boundary covers `TorchCamera`, foreground Gaussian initialization, chunked Gaussian map publication, and PLY export.

## Dataset Profiles

`gaussian_lic_bringup/config` includes ROS2 mapping profiles derived from the upstream Gaussian-LIC YAML files:

```text
fastlivo.yaml
fastlivo2.yaml
m2dgr.yaml
mcd.yaml
r3live.yaml
```

These files currently cover the ROS2 native mapper surface: topic names, synchronization/QoS settings, upstream camera intrinsics, image size, `select_every_k_frame`, depth-completion toggles, SH degree, Gaussian scaling seed, upstream optimizer/loss/exposure parameter names, output topics, and save-map service name. They are not complete tracking configs; upstream dataset rosbag paths, LiDAR/IMU/camera extrinsics, and LIC optimization weights still belong to Coco-LIC and need a native ROS2 tracking adapter before real bags can be launched as a full end-to-end Gaussian-LIC system.

For parameter-file smoke testing with the synthetic `1x1` demo bag, skip the red-pixel preview assertion:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh \
  --bag bags/synthetic_gs_demo \
  --config src/gaussian_lic_bringup/config/fastlivo2.yaml \
  --render-mode debug_cpu \
  --skip-rendered-data-check \
  --tf
```

## Local Dependency Probe

Current machine state:

```text
libtorch:  /home/frank/Software/libtorch
CUDA:      /usr/local/cuda-12.8
TensorRT:  not found
```

The ROS2 parameter contract now accepts `depth_completion`, `patch_size`, and `max_depth`, but TensorRT/SPNet depth completion is still inactive in this slice. Upstream Gaussian-LIC links TensorRT unconditionally; the ROS2 port keeps that dependency optional and consumes the provided depth topic until the backend is ported.

The optional torch backend can be built with:

```bash
GAUSSIAN_LIC_ENABLE_TORCH=ON ./scripts/build_jazzy.sh --packages-select gaussian_lic_mapping
```

It currently provides:

```text
MapperDataset CameraFrameRecord -> TorchCamera
OpenCV RGB/depth float matrices -> torch tensors
Eigen pose/intrinsics -> world-view/projection/full-projection tensors
MapperDataset pending points/colors/depth -> TorchGaussianMap initialization tensors
```

When `mapping_node` is built with `GAUSSIAN_LIC_ENABLE_TORCH=ON`, launch can enable live conversion with:

```bash
enable_torch_camera_conversion:=true
enable_torch_gaussian_init:=true
enable_torch_gaussian_extend:=true
torch_gaussian_device:=cpu
```

The Gaussian initialization mirrors the tensor boundary of upstream `GaussianModel::initialize()` and is gated on keyframes to match the upstream mapping loop:

```text
xyz:           [N, 3]
features_dc:   [N, 1, 3]
features_rest: [N, (sh_degree + 1)^2 - 1, 3]
scaling:       [N, 3]
rotation:      [N, 4]
opacity:       [N, 1]
```

The torch backend now supports optional upstream-style skybox seeding and incremental foreground insertion from pending keyframe points. It is still not the full mapper: differentiable rasterization, optimization, pruning/densification, and rasterized rendered-image publishing remain separate porting steps. This keeps the heavy torch dependency compile-time optional while allowing the live ROS2 data path to exercise the same tensor boundaries and map-growth lifecycle that the full Gaussian core will need.

After initialization and each keyframe extension, the node publishes the current map as chunked `gaussian_lic_msgs/msg/GaussianArray` on `/gaussian_lic/gaussian_map` with reliable transient-local QoS. The message uses public transport values:

```text
rotation_xyzw: internal [w, x, y, z] tensor converted to [x, y, z, w]
scale:         exp(internal log-scale tensor)
opacity:       sigmoid(internal opacity-logit tensor)
SH order:      DC RGB triplet followed by remaining coefficient RGB triplets
```

The `/gaussian_lic/save_map` service writes the initialized Gaussian map to `point_cloud.ply` when given a directory path, or directly to the requested `.ply` path. The Gaussian PLY properties follow upstream Gaussian-LIC naming: `f_dc_*`, `f_rest_*`, `opacity`, `scale_*`, and `rot_*`. These are raw optimization tensor values, not sigmoid/exp activated transport values.

When the torch Gaussian map is not initialized, the same service falls back to the accumulated debug map points and writes a plain XYZRGB PLY with `red/green/blue` uchar fields. This keeps native ROS2 smoke tests useful without requiring libtorch.
