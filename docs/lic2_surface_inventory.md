# Gaussian-LIC2 Surface Inventory

This inventory locks the public upstream surface used for the ROS2 Jazzy
paper-level migration. It is based on `external/Gaussian-LIC` at
`cd4c122dfad7e93255fe6862ac2c2b205e844786`.

## Repository State

`APRIL-ZJU/Gaussian-LIC` currently has no separate LIC2 branch or tag. The public
`master` README announces Gaussian-LIC2 and the checked tree contains the
Gaussian mapping, rasterizer, sparse optimizer, fused SSIM, simple-knn, and
TensorRT depth-completion sources needed by the mapping backend. The run path
still uses Coco-LIC for odometry/mapper input topics.

## Mapping Backend Files

```text
src/mapping.cpp
src/mapping.h
src/gaussian.cpp
src/gaussian.h
src/camera.h
src/tensor_utils.h
src/loss_utils.h
src/optim_utils.h
src/depth_completer.cpp
src/depth_completer.h
```

Important behavior to preserve in ROS2:

- `mapping.cpp` aligns `/points_for_gs`, `/pose_for_gs`, `/image_for_gs`, and
  `/depth_for_gs` at 10 ms tolerance.
- `Dataset::addFrame()` colorizes and accumulates keyframe points, optionally
  calls `DepthCompleter`, and stores `Camera` training/test views.
- `GaussianModel::initialize()` builds tensors for `xyz`, `features_dc`,
  `features_rest`, `scaling`, `rotation`, `opacity`, and optional exposure.
- `trainingSetup()` creates SparseGaussianAdam parameter groups for all six
  Gaussian parameter tensors.
- `optimize()` calls `render()`, uses RGB L1, fused SSIM, optional depth L1, and
  SparseGaussianAdam with the visible Gaussian mask.
- `extend()` appends new frame points through `densificationPostfix()` after
  alpha/depth/image-bound filtering.
- `saveMap()` writes upstream-compatible Gaussian PLY properties.

## CUDA Source Files

```text
src/simple-knn/spatial.cu
src/simple-knn/simple_knn.cu
src/fused-ssim/ssim.cu
src/rasterizer/rasterize_points.cu
src/rasterizer/cuda_rasterizer/adam.cu
src/rasterizer/cuda_rasterizer/forward.cu
src/rasterizer/cuda_rasterizer/backward.cu
src/rasterizer/cuda_rasterizer/rasterizer_impl.cu
```

The first migrated CUDA module is `simple-knn`, exposed by
`gaussian_lic_mapping/cuda/simple_knn.hpp` as `dist_cuda2(points[N,3])`. The
remaining rasterizer, fused-ssim, and SparseGaussianAdam modules still need to be
ported as native ROS2/ament CMake CUDA targets rather than calling into the ROS1
catkin target.

## Densification Scope

The current upstream does not expose classic 3DGS functions named
`densify_and_clone` or `densify_and_split`. The upstream growth mechanism visible
in `cd4c122` is:

```text
extend(dataset, gaussians)
GaussianModel::densificationPostfix(...)
```

The ROS2 port must first match this upstream behavior exactly. Gradient-aware
clone/split logic should only be added later if a future LIC2 upstream diff or
paper-level parity investigation proves it is required.

## Frontend/Tracking Surface

`external/Gaussian-LIC` does not contain a standalone native LIC2 frontend or
tracking executable. It expects Coco-LIC to publish the mapper contract topics.

Coco-LIC reference files for the eventual native ROS2 tracker:

```text
external/Coco-LIC/src/spline/*
external/Coco-LIC/src/odom/*
external/Coco-LIC/src/lidar/*
external/Coco-LIC/src/camera/r3live*
external/Coco-LIC/src/camera/loam/*
external/Coco-LIC/src/imu/*
```

Until that package is ported, `gaussian_lic_frontend/lic2_contract_adapter`
remains an adapter for externally supplied pose/odometry and raw sensor topics,
not the paper tracker.

## Strict Gate Gap

`baseline_readiness.py` currently checks data, baseline artifacts, current
artifacts, and upstream source status. It does not yet implement `--strict`, and
it does not compare PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, or paper-level ±5% metric drift.

The strict gate must be added before claiming paper-level reproduction.
