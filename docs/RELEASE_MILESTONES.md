# Release Milestones

## v0.1.0 - Baseline & Infrastructure

Goal: make strict reproduction measurable before the native algorithm port grows.

- Run and archive upstream Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 baseline artifacts for the selected FAST-LIVO2 sequence.
- Add rosbag conversion tooling for ROS1 `.bag` to rosbag2 `.mcap`.
- Keep Jazzy as the primary target and keep GitHub Actions on a Jazzy-only matrix.
- Keep `gaussian_lic_offline` available for non-launch rosbag2 artifact extraction.
- Freeze `/gaussian_lic/status` and `metrics.json` schemas for later CI comparison.
- Add performance regression gates for tracking FPS, mapping FPS, and iteration time.
- Add a trajectory regression gate for timestamp-associated TUM trajectory drift.
- Add a point-cloud regression gate for ASCII PLY map drift.
- Add a baseline manifest generator for archived ROS1 artifact fingerprinting.
- Add a FAST-LIVO2 data fetch/readiness gate for `CBD_Building_01`.
- Add a combined reproduction report that aggregates manifest, metrics, trajectory, and map gates.

## v0.2.0 - Gaussian-LIC2 ROS2 Native Frontend

Goal: the Gaussian-LIC2 frontend/tracking path runs natively in ROS2 without depending on a ROS1 runtime.

- Refactor timestamp math to `int64_t` nanoseconds before ROS2 API replacement.
- Keep `gaussian_lic_frontend/lic2_contract_adapter` as the raw-topic to mapper-contract boundary while the full odometry frontend is being ported.
- Port PointCloud2/Livox LiDAR input, IMU input, camera input, continuous-time trajectory, and odometry output against the released Gaussian-LIC2 upstream surface; if upstream still delegates odometry to legacy code, keep that boundary explicit and native in ROS2.
- Publish `/gaussian_lic/frontend/odometry`, `/gaussian_lic/frontend/path`, TF, and the mapper input topics:
  `/image_for_gs`, `/depth_for_gs`, `/pose_for_gs`, `/points_for_gs`.
- Compare trajectory against the ROS1 baseline with `scripts/trajectory_compare.py` and fail CI when drift exceeds the accepted threshold.
- Compare saved PLY maps against the ROS1 baseline with `scripts/pointcloud_compare.py` once the native map backend is active.

## v0.3.0 - Gaussian Mapping Full Backend

Goal: replace the debug mapping slice with the real Gaussian-LIC backend.

- Port CUDA rasterizer, simple-knn, fused-ssim, optimizer, densification, pruning, and upstream-compatible PLY persistence.
- Change the default render path to `render_mode:=rasterizer` after replacing the interim CPU Gaussian splat preview with the upstream CUDA rasterizer.
- Keep `render_mode:=debug_cpu` only as a temporary diagnostic path and remove it after v0.3 stabilization.
- Keep TensorRT/depth completion optional; `depth_completion:=false` must run without TensorRT installed, and SPNet engine generation must stay outside git.

## v0.4.0 - Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction

Goal: one-command paper-level reproduction on the selected FAST-LIVO2 sequence.

- Run full Gaussian-LIC2 frontend plus Gaussian mapping end to end from rosbag2.
- Generate `metrics.json`, trajectory, Gaussian PLY, rendered images, and comparison report.
- Compare ROS2 outputs against archived ROS1 baseline artifacts with `scripts/reproduction_report.py`.
- Publish release artifacts and expected screenshots/video for README and GitHub release notes.

Status as of 2026-05-05: the mapper-contract/CUDA strict `CBD_Building_01`
chain is executable against the archived ROS1 upstream baseline, and the latest archived strict `CBD_Building_01` report is green. The current artifact is
`results/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01_current_round_no_opacity_prune_probe`;
trajectory, novel PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS, GT-associated render-pair, and point-cloud
gates pass. Novel-view PSNR regresses 0.39%, point-cloud centroid drift is
0.147855 m, and the bidirectional nearest-neighbor mean distance is 0.099418 m
against the 0.100000 m strict threshold. SPNet TensorRT engine generation is
validated locally with TensorRT 10.9 on `sm_120`.
The native tracking path now has a launch smoke gate and analytic geometric
Jacobians for point-to-point, point-to-plane, and visual-alignment residuals,
plus runtime-gated bias observability and 2-DoF photometric translation
linearization status, dense-prior rank/singular-value marginalization health,
plus analytic SE3 photometric normal-equation and runtime sliding-window factor
coverage from rendered/current/depth images, with robust sample-quality status
gates. Full current IMU preintegration factors, pose-prior, state-prior,
retained dense-prior, IMU bias-continuity, and SE3 photometric window rows now
have analytic Jacobian coverage; full native Coco-LIC2 frontend parity remains
follow-up work.
The release gate for full-dataset parity is now executable via
`scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py` and intentionally reports incomplete
status until required native reference trajectory evidence and full-sequence
FAST-LIVO/M2DGR/MCD/R3LIVE strict artifacts are archived. Current local matrix
status is `required=2/7`, with FAST-LIVO2 mapper-contract/CUDA strict parity and
the 120s CBD native visual/SE3 BA health report passing.
The native tracking launch now defaults the sliding-window BA, visual-alignment
window factors, and SE3 photometric window factors to enabled so ordinary
tracking launch paths exercise the joint optimizer when the corresponding
sensor/render/depth inputs are present.
Optimized velocity and bias now feed back into odometry and safe IMU
propagation re-anchoring, and cubic B-spline pose/velocity trajectory queries
are available as the first deskew lookup source before IMU-history fallback.
`TrackingStatus` and the native smoke gate now expose optimized IMU re-anchor
counts and B-spline trajectory-control counts so the production BA feedback
path is runtime-observable.
