# Release Milestones

## v0.1.0 - Baseline & Infrastructure

Goal: make strict reproduction measurable before the native algorithm port grows.

- Run and archive ROS1 upstream Gaussian-LIC/Coco-LIC baseline artifacts for the selected FAST-LIVO2 sequence.
- Add rosbag conversion tooling for ROS1 `.bag` to rosbag2 `.mcap`.
- Keep Jazzy as the primary target and add Humble build-only CI scaffolding.
- Keep `gaussian_lic_offline` available for non-launch rosbag2 artifact extraction.
- Freeze `/gaussian_lic/status` and `metrics.json` schemas for later CI comparison.
- Add performance regression gates for tracking FPS, mapping FPS, and iteration time.

## v0.2.0 - Coco-LIC ROS2 Native Tracking

Goal: Coco-LIC runs natively in ROS2 without the Gaussian backend.

- Refactor timestamp math to `int64_t` nanoseconds before ROS2 API replacement.
- Port PointCloud2-first LiDAR input, IMU input, camera input, continuous-time trajectory, and odometry output.
- Publish `/cocolic/odometry`, `/cocolic/path`, TF, and the four mapper bridge topics:
  `/image_for_gs`, `/depth_for_gs`, `/pose_for_gs`, `/points_for_gs`.
- Compare trajectory against the ROS1 baseline and fail CI when drift exceeds the accepted threshold.

## v0.3.0 - Gaussian Mapping Full Backend

Goal: replace the debug mapping slice with the real Gaussian-LIC backend.

- Port CUDA rasterizer, simple-knn, fused-ssim, optimizer, densification, pruning, and upstream-compatible PLY persistence.
- Change the default render path to `render_mode:=rasterizer`.
- Keep `render_mode:=debug_cpu` only as a temporary diagnostic path and remove it after v0.3 stabilization.
- Keep TensorRT/depth completion optional; `depth_completion:=false` must run without TensorRT installed.

## v0.4.0 - Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction

Goal: one-command paper-level reproduction on the selected FAST-LIVO2 sequence.

- Run full Coco-LIC tracking plus Gaussian mapping end to end from rosbag2.
- Generate `metrics.json`, trajectory, Gaussian PLY, rendered images, and comparison report.
- Compare ROS2 outputs against archived ROS1 baseline artifacts.
- Publish release artifacts and expected screenshots/video for README and GitHub release notes.
