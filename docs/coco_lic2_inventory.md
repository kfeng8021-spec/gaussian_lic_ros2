# Coco-LIC Frontend Inventory

`external/Gaussian-LIC` still delegates odometry/tracking to Coco-LIC contract
topics. The native ROS2 tracker work therefore uses `external/Coco-LIC` as the
available continuous-time frontend surface.

ROS2 porting guardrails:

- Timestamp math must use signed `int64_t` nanoseconds in trajectory, IMU,
  LiDAR deskew, and camera query code.
- The default native tracker executor must preserve ROS1-style callback order
  unless a module proves it is thread-safe.
- Sensor QoS must remain explicit; high-rate image/LiDAR/IMU topics default to
  volatile bounded best-effort unless a dataset replay requires reliable.
- tf2 lookup, rosbag2 replay, and `/clock` semantics must be tested against
  baseline before enabling strict reproduction gates.

Current ROS2 implementation status:

- `gaussian_lic_tracking::TrajectoryManager` provides the first native
  timestamp-safe cubic B-spline trajectory primitive with a constant-velocity
  probe and negative-time roundtrip coverage.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking::ImuPropagator` now keeps a bounded signed-nanosecond
  IMU state history for interpolation, and `ImuPreintegrator` stores raw IMU
  samples so the sliding window can reintegrate factors with candidate gyro and
  accelerometer biases.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking::LidarFactor` provides the first native LIO residual
  foundation: bounded local map insertion, sampled nearest-neighbor residuals,
  bounded 6-DoF correction, direct point-to-point correspondence factors for
  the optional sliding window, point-to-plane correspondence factors, robust
  per-correspondence weights, and deterministic probes.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking::deskew_lidar_points` performs per-point LiDAR deskew
  from PointCloud2 time fields before mapper publication and LIO correction.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking::SlidingWindowOptimizer` provides the first native
  optimization container for IMU preintegration factors, raw-sample bias
  reintegration, bias continuity residuals, pose priors, full-state priors, and
  marginalization-prior anchoring, plus direct LiDAR point-to-point,
  point-to-plane, and visual-alignment factors. Geometric rows now use analytic
  SE3 Jacobians, while IMU and dense-prior rows keep finite-difference fallback.
  The optimizer has bounded window trimming, Schur-complement retained-window
  priors, and deterministic convergence probes. It is exposed as an optional
  tracking-node path while the production Coco-LIC2 BA factors are ported.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking::VisualFactor` provides the first native photometric
  residual, integer/subpixel image-alignment foundation, and 2-DoF photometric
  translation linearization. `tracking_node` subscribes to
  `/gaussian_lic/rendered_image`, publishes the visual alignment and photometric
  linearization through `TrackingStatus`, and the launch smoke gate now proves
  the mapper-render comparison reaches the optional sliding window.
- `tracking_node` also subscribes to `/gaussian_lic/gaussian_map`
  `GaussianArray` chunks and caches chunk-complete Gaussian snapshots, giving
  the frontend a native Gaussian-map reverse channel. Cached Gaussian centers
  can now generate optional point-to-point tracking-window factors while the
  full photometric Gaussian residual is ported.
- Production sliding-window BA, full SE3 camera photometric Jacobians, robust
  IMU bias observability from LIO/VIO factors, and Coco-LIC2-grade
  IMU/LiDAR/camera joint optimization still need to be ported from the audited
  Coco-LIC modules.
