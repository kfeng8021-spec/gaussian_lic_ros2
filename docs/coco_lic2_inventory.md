# Coco-LIC Frontend Inventory

`external/Gaussian-LIC` still delegates odometry/tracking to Coco-LIC contract
topics. The native ROS2 tracker work therefore uses `external/Coco-LIC` as the
available continuous-time frontend surface.

ROS2 porting guardrails:

- Timestamp math must use signed `int64_t` nanoseconds in trajectory, IMU,
  LiDAR deskew, and camera query code.
- The default native tracker executor must preserve ROS1-style callback order
  unless a module proves it is thread-safe.
- Sensor QoS must remain explicit; high-rate image/LiDAR/IMU topics default to
  volatile bounded best-effort unless a dataset replay requires reliable.
- tf2 lookup, rosbag2 replay, and `/clock` semantics must be tested against
  baseline before enabling strict reproduction gates.

Current ROS2 implementation status:

- `gaussian_lic_tracking::TrajectoryManager` provides the first native
  timestamp-safe cubic B-spline trajectory primitive with a constant-velocity
  probe and negative-time roundtrip coverage.
- LIO factors, VIO factors, sliding-window BA, and native odometry publishers
  still need to be ported from the audited Coco-LIC modules.
