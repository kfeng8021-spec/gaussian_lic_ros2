# Roadmap

The public release plan is milestone-based:

- `v0.1.0` Baseline & Infrastructure
- `v0.2.0` Gaussian-LIC2 ROS2 Native Frontend
- `v0.3.0` Gaussian Mapping Full Backend
- `v0.4.0` Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction

See `docs/RELEASE_MILESTONES.md` for release criteria and artifacts.

## Immediate Next Step

Strict baseline data gate:

```text
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo --sequence CBD_Building_01
```

First concrete action:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_fastlivo2_sequence.py \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --output-dir /home/frank/data/fast_livo
```

Current execution gate:

```bash
./scripts/upstream_baseline_build_attempt.sh
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py \
  --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo \
  --baseline-dir baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01 \
  --current-results-dir results/fastlivo2/current \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01
```

As of 2026-05-04, `CBD_Building_01` download is blocked by Google Drive quota. The upstream ROS1 `gs_mapping` target builds successfully in Docker with the local OpenCV 4.10 CUDA fallback and TensorRT 8.6.1.6. Strict OpenCV 4.7.0 is still incomplete locally.

To avoid waiting on the quota-blocked strict sequence, the current executable substitute is the official FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall` bag, curated to the first 8 seconds. It now has:

```text
baseline/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_curated_8s/
results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current/reproduction_report.json
```

Required baseline artifacts:

```text
trajectory.tum
point_cloud.ply
renders/
metrics.json
run.log
baseline_manifest.json
```
