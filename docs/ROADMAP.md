# Roadmap

The public release plan is milestone-based:

- `v0.1.0` Baseline & Infrastructure
- `v0.2.0` Coco-LIC ROS2 Native Tracking
- `v0.3.0` Gaussian Mapping Full Backend
- `v0.4.0` Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction

See `docs/RELEASE_MILESTONES.md` for release criteria and artifacts.

## Immediate Next Step

Blocker:

```text
FAST-LIVO2 bag data is required at /home/frank/data/fast_livo/
```

First concrete action:

```bash
docker pull ros:noetic-ros-base-focal
```

Then bring up Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS1 Noetic, run the upstream Gaussian-LIC/Coco-LIC baseline on FAST-LIVO2, and archive outputs under:

```text
baseline/fastlivo2/<sequence>/
```

Required baseline artifacts:

```text
trajectory.tum
point_cloud.ply
renders/
metrics.json
run.log
```

## Milestone 0: ROS2 Foundation

## Milestone 2: Gaussian-LIC Mapping Port

- [x] Inventory ROS1 APIs used by upstream Gaussian-LIC.
- [x] Replace the four-topic ROS1 input synchronization surface with native ROS2.
- [x] Convert aligned ROS2 frames into mapper-ready image/depth/pose/point data.
- [x] Consume CameraInfo intrinsics with parameter fallback.
- [x] Accumulate converted frames into a non-torch `MapperDataset`.
- [x] Publish ROS2 odometry, path, and accumulated map-point topics from the native mapper.
- [x] Add optional `map -> camera` TF broadcasting.
- [x] Port upstream Gaussian-LIC backend parameter names into ROS2 profiles.
- [ ] Replace remaining ROS1 node handles, publishers, and launch files.
- [ ] Isolate CUDA/Gaussian map code from ROS middleware code.
- [x] Add optional libtorch/CUDA build path.
- [x] Add live `MapperDataset -> TorchCamera` conversion behind a build flag.
- [x] Add foreground `MapperDataset -> TorchGaussianMap` initialization behind a build flag.
- [x] Add keyframe-gated skybox seeding and incremental foreground Gaussian insertion.
- [x] Publish initialized and extended Gaussian map as chunked `GaussianArray`.
- [x] Add save-map service for initialized Gaussian PLY export.
- [x] Add save-map fallback for accumulated debug XYZRGB PLY export.
- [x] Publish CPU projected-map preview on `/gaussian_lic/rendered_image`.
- [x] Register `mapping_node` as an `rclcpp_components` composable node.
- [x] Add configurable input sensor QoS for ROS2 driver/rosbag2 compatibility.
- [x] Fill `MappingStatus` tracking/mapping rate fields from live frame counters.
- [x] Make TensorRT depth completion optional at the ROS2 mapper input boundary.
- [ ] Port Gaussian rasterization, optimization, densification, and pruning.
