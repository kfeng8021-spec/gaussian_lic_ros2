# Roadmap

The public release plan is milestone-based:

- `v0.1.0` Baseline & Infrastructure
- `v0.2.0` Gaussian-LIC2 ROS2 Native Frontend
- `v0.3.0` Gaussian Mapping Full Backend
- `v0.4.0` Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction

See `docs/RELEASE_MILESTONES.md` for release criteria and artifacts.

## Immediate Next Step

Baseline data gate:

```text
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo --sequence CBD_Building_01
```

First concrete action:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_fastlivo2_sequence.py \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --output-dir /home/frank/data/fast_livo
```

Current execution gate:

```bash
./scripts/upstream_baseline_build_attempt.sh
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py \
  --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo \
  --baseline-dir baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01 \
  --current-results-dir results/fastlivo2/current \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01
```

As of 2026-05-04, `CBD_Building_01` download is blocked by Google Drive quota. The upstream ROS1 build is blocked on TensorRT SDK. Strict OpenCV 4.7.0 is still incomplete locally, but the existing OpenCV 4.10 CUDA build removes the OpenCV blocker in a fallback build attempt. `Bright_Screen_Wall` is the first official FAST-LIVO2 bag that has passed the ROS2 raw-sensor adapter replay.

Then bring up the upstream baseline environment, run Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 on FAST-LIVO2, and archive outputs under:

```text
baseline/fastlivo2/<sequence>/
```

Required baseline artifacts:

```text
trajectory.tum
point_cloud.ply
renders/
metrics.json
run.log
baseline_manifest.json
```
