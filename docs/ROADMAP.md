# Roadmap

The public release plan is milestone-based:

- `v0.1.0` Baseline & Infrastructure
- `v0.2.0` Gaussian-LIC2 ROS2 Native Frontend
- `v0.3.0` Gaussian Mapping Full Backend
- `v0.4.0` Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction

See `docs/RELEASE_MILESTONES.md` for release criteria and artifacts.

## Current Truth

The current repository is a strong ROS2 plumbing and reproducibility checkpoint, not a complete paper-level Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 algorithm port.

Completed proof/evidence scope:

- ROS2 workspace, messages, launch, composable mapper node, dataset profiles, bag contracts, artifact extraction, and CI artifact gates.
- Native mapper input contract and `lic2_contract_adapter` boundary for raw camera/LiDAR/IMU plus pose/odometry.
- Optional Torch Gaussian tensor path with keyframe initialization, skybox seeding, foreground append, gradient-aware densification, multi-criteria pruning, opacity reset scheduling, CUDA rasterizer preview, CUDA rasterizer/fused-SSIM/depth loss, visibility-masked SparseGaussianAdam updates for the full Gaussian parameter set, and optional TensorRT/SPNet depth completion.
- Official FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall` substitute report with `metrics`, `trajectory`, `point_cloud`, and `gaussian_color` gates passing.

Incomplete paper-algorithm scope:

- `lic2_contract_adapter` is not the native continuous-time Gaussian-LIC/Coco-LIC tracker.
- TensorRT/SPNet depth completion requires a generated SPNet TensorRT engine path at runtime; no `.engine` artifact is checked into this repository.
- The public LIC2 upstream surface does not currently expose separate 2D Gaussian primitive or skybox patches beyond the checked mapper backend.
- Strict `CBD_Building_01` paper reproduction is blocked until the official bag is available locally and the native algorithm path is complete.

## Immediate Next Step

Strict baseline data gate:

```text
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo --sequence CBD_Building_01
```

First concrete action:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_fastlivo2_sequence.py \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --output-dir /home/frank/data/fast_livo
```

Current execution gate:

```bash
./scripts/upstream_baseline_build_attempt.sh
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py \
  --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo \
  --baseline-dir baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01 \
  --current-results-dir results/fastlivo2/current \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --strict
```

As of 2026-05-04, `CBD_Building_01` is being fetched from the official Google
Drive file ID discovered by `scripts/fetch_fastlivo2_sequence.py`. The upstream
ROS1 `gs_mapping` target builds successfully in Docker with the local OpenCV
4.10 CUDA fallback and TensorRT 8.6.1.6. Strict OpenCV 4.7.0 is still incomplete
locally.

To avoid waiting on the quota-blocked strict sequence, the current executable substitute is the official FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall` bag, curated to the first 8 seconds. The latest colorized combined proof chain has:

```text
baseline/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_fastlivo2_color_8s/
results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_fullseq/reproduction_report.json
```

That Bright substitute passing report is not a replacement for the strict paper gate.

Required baseline artifacts:

```text
trajectory.tum
point_cloud.ply
renders/
metrics.json
run.log
baseline_manifest.json
```
