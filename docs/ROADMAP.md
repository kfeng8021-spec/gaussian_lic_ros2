# Roadmap

The public release plan is milestone-based:

- `v0.1.0` Baseline & Infrastructure
- `v0.2.0` Gaussian-LIC2 ROS2 Native Frontend
- `v0.3.0` Gaussian Mapping Full Backend
- `v0.4.0` Strict FAST-LIVO2 Reproduction

See `docs/RELEASE_MILESTONES.md` for release criteria and artifacts.

## Current Truth

The current repository is a strong ROS2 plumbing and reproducibility checkpoint, not a complete paper-level Gaussian-LIC/Gaussian-LIC2 algorithm port.

Completed proof/evidence scope:

- ROS2 workspace, messages, launch, composable mapper node, dataset profiles, bag contracts, artifact extraction, and CI artifact gates.
- Native mapper input contract and `lic2_contract_adapter` boundary for raw camera/LiDAR/IMU plus pose/odometry.
- Optional Torch Gaussian tensor path with keyframe initialization, skybox seeding, foreground append, gradient-aware densification, multi-criteria pruning, opacity reset scheduling, CUDA rasterizer preview, CUDA rasterizer/fused-SSIM/depth loss, visibility-masked SparseGaussianAdam updates for the full Gaussian parameter set, and optional TensorRT/SPNet depth completion.
- Official FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall` substitute report with `metrics`, `trajectory`, `point_cloud`, and `gaussian_color` gates passing.
- Strict FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01` local reproduction report with trajectory, PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS, GT-associated render pairs, and Chamfer gates passing against the archived ROS1 upstream baseline.

Incomplete paper-algorithm scope:

- `lic2_contract_adapter` is not the native continuous-time Gaussian-LIC/Coco-LIC tracker.
- TensorRT/SPNet depth completion has a generated local TensorRT 10.9 FP16 engine path and benchmark; large checkpoint/ONNX/engine artifacts stay outside git.
- The public LIC2 upstream surface does not currently expose separate 2D Gaussian primitive or skybox patches beyond the checked mapper backend.
- Full native Coco-LIC2 frontend/tracking parity remains outside the current mapper-contract strict reproduction gate.

## Current Execution Gate

Strict baseline data gate:

```text
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo --sequence CBD_Building_01
```

If the raw bag is missing, fetch it with:

```bash
./scripts/fetch_fastlivo2_sequence.py \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --output-dir /home/frank/data/fast_livo
```

Current execution gate:

```bash
./scripts/upstream_baseline_build_attempt.sh
./scripts/baseline_readiness.py \
  --dataset-root /home/frank/data/fast_livo \
  --baseline-dir baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01 \
  --current-results-dir results/fastlivo2/current \
  --sequence CBD_Building_01 \
  --strict
```

As of 2026-05-05, `/home/frank/data/fast_livo/CBD_Building_01.bag` is present
locally, the upstream ROS1 `gs_mapping` target builds in Docker with the local
OpenCV 4.10 CUDA fallback and TensorRT 8.6.1.6, and
`baseline/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01/` contains the archived ROS1 upstream
baseline (`trajectory.tum`, `point_cloud.ply`, `renders/`, `metrics.json`, and
`run.log`). The ROS2 strict current report at
`results/fastlivo2/CBD_Building_01_current_round_no_opacity_prune_probe/`
passes the local paper metric gate.

The official FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall` bag remains the quick executable
substitute for short regression coverage. The latest colorized combined proof
chain has:

```text
baseline/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_fastlivo2_color_8s/
results/fastlivo2/Bright_Screen_Wall_current_extrinsic_color_fullseq/reproduction_report.json
```

That Bright substitute passing report is now a fast regression companion to the
strict `CBD_Building_01` paper gate, not a replacement for it.

Required baseline artifacts:

```text
trajectory.tum
point_cloud.ply
renders/
metrics.json
run.log
baseline_manifest.json
```

- [x] FAST-LIVO2 data fetch/readiness scripts for executable baseline status.
- [x] Reproducible ROS1 upstream baseline build-attempt script for the local Noetic Docker environment.
- [x] Add a ROS2 current-results collector that records mapper outputs and writes `trajectory.tum`, `point_cloud.ply`, and `metrics.json`.
- [x] Add `--strict` reproduction readiness that fails on missing PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS and enforces the 5% paper metric gate.
- [x] Jazzy CI smoke tests with a generated mini rosbag2 sequence.
- [x] ROS1 upstream baseline archive for the official curated FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall_curated_8s` substitute.
- [x] ROS1 `.bag` to rosbag2 `.mcap` converter backend.
- [x] PR comparison report on real or curated mini-sequence artifacts.
- [x] Resumable strict `CBD_Building_01` pipeline entrypoint from official bag to strict report.
- [x] Strict `CBD_Building_01` ROS1 upstream baseline archive from the official local bag.
- [x] Strict report quality extraction fills PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS from render/GT pairs, with lpipsPyTorch fallback for CPU report environments.
- [x] Strict rasterizer current collection forwards CUDA optimization and pruning controls so runtime does not silently run zero optimizer steps.
- [x] Strict ROS1 baseline visual dump continues after LPIPS runtime failures, so render/GT pairs are not capped at the first frame.
- [x] Strict ROS2 current collection saves final-map train/test re-renders from `SaveMap` instead of judging the live preview topic.
- [x] Strict `CBD_Building_01` current collection uses the FAST-LIVO2 profile cadence (`select_every_k_frame=5`) so ROS2 train/test render names align with the ROS1 upstream baseline.
- [x] Strict frontend adapter matches the ROS1 mapper-contract fallback by rotating FAST-LIVO2 point clouds into the IMU-pose world frame before the mapper consumes them.
- [x] Strict current collection disables high-rate `GaussianArray` visualization publication and uses a 1.5M foreground cap, reducing the local output bag from 38.7 GiB to 3.7 GiB while preserving metric artifacts.
- [x] Strict current collection supports foreground count-cap policy selection and defaults the strict CUDA run to uniform pruning, preserving insertion-order spatial coverage better than opacity-only top-k pruning.
- [x] Strict CUDA extension filters pending points to current-view alpha holes before appending, matching the upstream Gaussian-LIC `extend()` visibility semantics instead of adding every synchronized LiDAR sample.
- [x] Strict CUDA current collection records the PyTorch allocator policy in `metrics.json` and defaults CUDA runs to `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` to reduce late-run fragmentation OOMs around million-Gaussian maps.
- [x] Strict CUDA current collection disables the ROS2-only periodic opacity reset by default, matching released Gaussian-LIC2 optimizer behavior and preventing final-map renders from being saved right after all foreground opacity is reset to 0.01.
- [x] Strict CUDA current collection disables ROS2 gradient split/clone densification by default, matching released Gaussian-LIC2 append-only `extend()` and avoiding the large blurred splats seen when the diagnostic split/clone path is forced on.
- [x] Strict report treats unavailable generic runtime performance keys as skipped when quality/trajectory/point-cloud paper gates are present, so `tracking_hz`/`mapping_hz` absence does not mask the real paper gate failures.
- [x] Strict report samples render pairs evenly across the full sequence instead of only the first sorted frames, and the point-cloud count gate now uses declared PLY vertex counts rather than the downsampled load sample.
- [x] Packaged dataset profiles and launch defaults are CUDA/rasterizer-first, while `collect_current_results.sh` still explicitly disables Torch when the caller omits `--torch`.
- [x] Strict CUDA optimization uses upstream-style random train-camera sampling plus shuffle by default, with a fixed seed for reproducible ROS2 reports and `seed=0` available for upstream `random_device` behavior.
- [x] ROS2 fallback projected-depth generation now matches the ROS1 mapper-contract converter's nearest-pixel rounding semantics; RGB projection remains floor-based because the ROS1 converter uses floor for color.
- [x] Strict report uses current saved GT frames for ROS2 quality extraction and decoded-GT hash association for ROS1-vs-ROS2 render-pair comparison, avoiding false failures when rosbag2 replay drops or reorders frame names relative to the ROS1 baseline.
- [x] Strict CUDA current defaults to no opacity pruning for released LIC2 append-only parity; foreground count limiting remains available through the uniform count-cap policy.
- [x] Strict `CBD_Building_01` ROS2 current report with trajectory coverage, render pairs, PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS, and Chamfer within the paper gate.
  - 2026-05-05 local strict run with upstream-random optimizer-frame sampling, ROS1-compatible depth rounding, current-GT quality extraction, decoded-GT render-pair association, disabled split/clone densification, disabled opacity reset, no opacity pruning, alpha-hole extension filtering, and zero optimizer OOMs passes `baseline_readiness.py --strict` and `reproduction_report.py --strict`.

  - GT-associated render-pair smoke gate passes with 1063 matched frames, 64 sampled pairs, mean PSNR 21.60 dB, mean SSIM 0.785, min PSNR 17.45 dB, and min SSIM 0.478.
  - Point-cloud parity passes: centroid drift 0.148 m, bidirectional nearest mean 0.0994 m, nearest RMSE 0.1455 m, unmatched ratio 2.83%, and declared point-count ratio 0.978.

  - TensorRT 10.9 CUDA 12.8 builds `/home/frank/Software/TensorRT-engines/spnet_512_640_fp16.engine` for the RTX 5070 Ti `sm_120` GPU.
  - Mean `trtexec` latency is 26.4492 ms at `512x640`, below the 30 ms/frame target.
