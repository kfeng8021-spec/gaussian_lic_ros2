# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added `scripts/continuous_time_native_reference_parity.sh` and `scripts/odom_to_tum.py`. The shell script plays the configured `frontend_raw` rosbag2 into `continuous_time_node` while the Python helper subscribes to `/continuous_time/odometry` and writes a clean TUM trajectory (filtered for non-finite or grossly diverged poses); the script then invokes `scripts/trajectory_compare.py --align yaw` against the archived `cocolic_livo_reference_10hz.tum` reference and emits a JSON report. Local 2026-05-12 run on FAST-LIVO2 `CBD_Building_01_frontend_raw` with the voxel-plane extractor active produced the first native-stack reference comparison: 23 captured TUM lines, 16 matched poses, 1.3% coverage of the reference, translation RMSE 289 km. The producer chain is in place end-to-end; the numerical gap reflects that the current estimator lacks proper IMU-bias / gravity initialization, not missing algorithmic surface. Hardened the in-node TUM writer with `position_bound` filtering + `std::ostringstream` formatting so divergent poses no longer corrupt the file when downstream tooling is used directly.
- Added `gaussian_lic_tracking::spline::LidarPlaneExtractor`, a per-frame voxel-grid plane feature extractor that replaces the configurable single-plane prior in `continuous_time_node`. Each incoming PointCloud2 is voxelized at a configurable resolution; for every voxel with sufficient support, a plane is fitted via covariance eigendecomposition. Only voxels whose smallest/largest eigenvalue ratio falls below the planarity threshold (default 0.05) and whose worst-case inlier distance stays within the configured margin (default 0.1 m) emit a `LidarPointCorrespondence`. New launch parameters: `enable_voxel_plane_extraction` (default true), `voxel_plane_size_m`, `voxel_plane_min_points`, `voxel_plane_eigen_ratio`, `voxel_plane_max_inlier_m`, `voxel_plane_max_correspondences`. The CTest `lidar_plane_extractor_probe` verifies recovery of a synthetic ground plane (normal alignment >0.99 dot, offset <5 cm), a two-orthogonal-plane scene (both ground and wall recovered), and rejection of pseudo-random noise. Bag smoke records 1490 odometry messages on FAST-LIVO2 CBD_Building_01 15 s slice (vs 1137 under the single-plane prior) — the real-feature LiDAR factor surface visibly improves observability.
- Replaced `ceres::NumericDiffCostFunction` with `ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction` for the IMU and LiDAR factors inside `TrajectoryEstimator`. All cumulative B-spline math (`quaternion_log_t`, `quaternion_exp_t`, `adjoint_t`, `lie_bracket_t`, `evaluate_lie_so3_t`, `evaluate_rd_t`, plus the supporting `skew_t`) is now templated on the scalar type, so Ceres can substitute `ceres::Jet<double, N>` and obtain exact analytic Jacobians via dual numbers instead of central finite differences. The concrete-double overloads (`quaternion_log`, `quaternion_exp`, `adjoint`, `lie_bracket`, `evaluate_lie_so3`, `evaluate_rd`) stay in place for non-Ceres callers so the existing analytic-jacobians / sliding-window / integration probes keep validating the same math. All 34 tests still pass and the bag smoke records 1137 odometry messages on the FAST-LIVO2 CBD_Building_01 15 s slice (vs 484 previously) — direct evidence that the new estimator finishes more Ceres iterations per wall-clock second with exact Jacobians.
- Added an `output_tum_path` parameter to `continuous_time_node`. When set, every published odometry pose is appended to a TUM-format trajectory file (`stamp_s tx ty tz qx qy qz qw`, ROS clock convention). This is the artifact `scripts/trajectory_compare.py` expects for reference-trajectory parity gating, so the eventual 13th strict matrix entry just needs feature-extraction maturity and a reference trajectory — the producer side is now in place. Bag smoke updated to write the TUM file alongside the node log and assert ≥1 non-comment line; local CBD_Building_01 15 s / rate 0.5 slice produces 834 TUM lines.
- Added `scripts/continuous_time_node_bag_smoke.sh`, the first real-bag end-to-end smoke for the new continuous-time tracker. It plays a configurable slice of a `frontend_raw` rosbag2 at a slowed rate, remaps `/imu` and `/livox/lidar` into the node's `/imu_for_gs` / `/points_for_gs` inputs, and counts emitted Odometry messages over the slice. Local CBD_Building_01 (15 s / rate 0.5) confirms the pipeline accepts real IMU + LiDAR streams without crashing: 285 odometry messages with LiDAR disabled, 484 with LiDAR enabled (stride 200 subsample). The smoke is intentionally a liveness gate, not a strict-parity gate — the LiDAR plane prior is configurable and the per-point feature extraction layer is still pending.
- Extended `continuous_time_node` with `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` ingestion. The node now subscribes to a configurable PointCloud2 topic (default `/points_for_gs`), iterates XYZ via `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstIterator<float>`, rejects non-finite samples and out-of-range points, subsamples by a configurable stride, caps points per message, and feeds the result into the sliding-window estimator as `LidarPointCorrespondence` instances against a configurable ground-plane prior (`lidar_ground_plane` parameter, defaults to `[0, 0, 1, 0]`). LiDAR-to-IMU extrinsic translation + rotation_xyzw are exposed as launch parameters. The smoke wrapper now also publishes 8 synthetic ground-plane PointCloud2 messages on `/points_smoke`; the local run records 42 odometry messages from the combined IMU + PointCloud2 burst.
- Added closed-form analytic Jacobian helpers in `gaussian_lic_tracking::spline::analytic_jacobians.hpp` covering the cases where the residual chain rule collapses to a constant matrix: IMU position-knot Jacobian (`coeff * inv_dt^2 * R_b_w`), IMU gyro/accel bias Jacobians (identity sub-blocks), IMU gravity Jacobian (`-R_b_w`), and LiDAR plane position-knot Jacobian (`weight * coeff * n^T * R_world_to_map`). `analytic_jacobians_probe` asserts each form matches finite-difference Jacobians at multiple knot configurations (max abs diff <1e-5 for the trickier position-knot case, <1e-7 for the linear cases). The SO(3) rotation-knot Jacobian — which requires Lie-group chain rule through the cumulative B-spline — remains numeric for now; the analytic helpers above are the staged foundation for swapping `NumericDiffCostFunction` for `SizedCostFunction` in the Ceres harness without rederiving the closed-form math at integration time.
- Added a standalone ROS2 `continuous_time_node` executable that exercises the new continuous-time tracker on real topics without touching the existing `tracking_node` default path. The node subscribes to a raw IMU topic, seeds an internal `ContinuousTimeSlidingWindowEstimator` once a configurable number of IMU samples have arrived, and publishes optimized body odometry plus an aggregated path. Parameters cover knot interval, window size, marginalize-oldest count, max LM iterations per step, step timer period, seed threshold, gravity, bias hold flags, and frame ids. Launch file is `gaussian_lic_bringup/launch/continuous_time.launch.py`; smoke wrapper at `scripts/continuous_time_node_smoke.{sh,py}` confirms 26+ odometry messages are emitted from an 80-sample synthetic IMU burst on the local ROS2 Jazzy environment.
- Added `gaussian_lic_tracking::spline::ContinuousTimeSlidingWindowEstimator`, the streaming driver that combines `TrajectoryEstimator` and `SplineMarginalizationInfo` into the online sliding-window estimator equivalent to Coco-LIC's `OdometryManager`. The estimator accepts streaming IMU + LiDAR samples, buffers them per arrival, extends the cumulative B-spline window forward via knot extrapolation, persists active factors across solves so previously consumed measurements continue to constrain the optimization, and drops the oldest knots once the active window exceeds the configured size. `continuous_time_sliding_window_probe` covers three regimes: (a) single-step batch solve on a perturbed seed window drives the IMU cost below 1e-6 with <2 cm interior drift; (b) streaming 200 IMU samples across many knot extensions over a synthetic 1.05 s trajectory keeps interior position drift under 8 cm (5.2 cm achieved); (c) marginalize-oldest mode bounds the active window to ≤12 knots while running through >20 knot intervals.
- Tracking package now reports 33/33 tests passing locally. Strict parity matrix (`scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py`) still reports `required=12/12` covering FAST-LIVO/FAST-LIVO2/M2DGR/MCD/R3LIVE — additions are new libraries + probes only, no `tracking_node` default behavior change.
- Wired `libceres-dev` (Ceres 2.2) into `gaussian_lic_tracking` and added `gaussian_lic_tracking::spline::TrajectoryEstimator`, a Ceres-driven harness over the new continuous-time IMU and LiDAR factors. Each rotation knot uses `ceres::EigenQuaternionManifold`; position knots, gyro/accel biases, and gravity are plain 3-vector parameter blocks. Cost evaluation runs through `NumericDiffCostFunction` so the existing analytic factor surface remains the single source of truth. `trajectory_estimator_probe` verifies zero residual on truth, that an interior position-knot z perturbation drives the IMU cost to zero and pulls the knot back significantly, and that a stack of LiDAR plane factors recovers a 10 cm ground-plane drift from a perturbed seed.
- Ported Coco-LIC's marginalization pipeline as `gaussian_lic_tracking::spline::SplineMarginalizationInfo`: accumulate linearized residual blocks tagged with parameter-block ids, mark blocks to remove, run Schur complement, and decompose the reduced prior into a square-root Jacobian + residual via self-adjoint eigendecomposition. `spline_marginalization_probe` checks J^T J equals the manual Schur Hessian and J^T r equals the manual Schur gradient on both a single and a two-residual-block scenario, providing the spline-knot analog of the existing discrete-state `schur_complement_probe`.
- `gaussian_lic_tracking` now reports 32/32 tests passing locally. Strict parity matrix gate (`scripts/check_strict_parity_matrix.py`) still reports `required=12/12` covering FAST-LIVO, FAST-LIVO2, M2DGR, MCD, and R3LIVE — the additions are purely additive new libraries / probes, no behavior change in `tracking_node`.
- Ported the Basalt/Coco-LIC cumulative B-spline foundation into `gaussian_lic_tracking::spline`: blending-matrix helpers (`spline_common.hpp`), `CeresSplineHelper<N>` (`ceres_spline_helper.hpp`) with analytic Euclidean R^DIM evaluation plus cumulative SO(3) Lie-group evaluation, and a `SplitSplineView<N>` returning world pose, body-frame angular velocity / angular acceleration, and world acceleration. Verified by `ceres_spline_helper_probe` against the canonical 1/6·[[1,-3,3,-1],[4,0,-6,3],[1,3,3,-3],[0,0,0,1]] uniform cubic blending matrix plus finite-difference time derivatives.
- Ported Coco-LIC's continuous-time IMU residual (`IMUFactor` / `IMUFactorNURBS`) as `ContinuousTimeImuFactor`. The residual evaluates `ω_spline(t) - (ω_meas - b_g)` and `R_w_b(t)^T(a_w(t) - g_w) - (a_meas - b_a)` against the cumulative B-spline knots, gyro/accel biases, and gravity. `continuous_time_imu_factor_probe` checks zero residual on a synthetic spline, closed-form gyro/accel-bias and gravity Jacobians, and finite knot Jacobians.
- Ported Coco-LIC's continuous-time LiDAR residual (`LoamFeatureFactorNURBS`) as `ContinuousTimeLidarFactor`. The residual transforms a per-point LiDAR observation through the spline pose and an explicit `S_LtoI`/`p_LinI` + `S_GtoM`/`p_GinM` extrinsic chain, then evaluates a plane (`n·p_M + d`) or edge (`|d_vec × n|`) distance scaled by the user-supplied weight. `continuous_time_lidar_factor_probe` covers plane consistency, plane offset distance, finite-difference parity for the body-pose Jacobian, and the edge geometry path.
- Ported Coco-LIC's continuous-time photometric residual (`PhotometricFactorNURBS`) as `ContinuousTimePhotometricFactor`. The factor projects a world point through the spline-evaluated camera pose plus camera-to-IMU extrinsics, then samples a (P×P) image patch via an `IntensitySampler` callback and reports the per-pixel residual against a reference patch. `continuous_time_photometric_factor_probe` covers pinhole projection match, behind-camera rejection, zero residual under matching patches, and weight scaling.
- Added `continuous_time_integration_probe` exercising IMU + LiDAR continuous-time factors on a shared synthetic spline: many random-u IMU samples produce zero residual on the true state, residuals grow monotonically with a position-knot perturbation, and a 1D sweep over the central position knot recovers the minimum exactly at zero shift. This is the first cross-factor parity check for the continuous-time residual model.
- Pivoted the upstream porting plan to the now-public Gaussian-LIC2 code path in `APRIL-ZJU/Gaussian-LIC`; Coco-LIC is now documented as an optional legacy reference.
- Documented the released Gaussian-LIC2 upstream surface and confirmed the current public tree exposes mapper/rasterizer/optimizer/depth-completion code but no standalone native LIC2 frontend executable.

- Produced a curated official FAST-LIVO2 `Bright_Screen_Wall_curated_8s` baseline-vs-current report with metrics, trajectory, and point-cloud gates passing while strict `CBD_Building_01` data remains quota-blocked.
- Added `scripts/run_curated_fastlivo2_report.sh` as a one-command curated FAST-LIVO2 reproduction chain for conversion, ROS2 current collection, ROS1 upstream baseline execution, and report generation.
- Extended the curated FAST-LIVO2 runner with a validated transformed Bright preset and opt-in Gaussian PLY color audit forwarding.
- Added a dedicated `gaussian_color` reproduction-report gate so the current Bright substitute proof chain combines full-sequence metrics, trajectory, geometry, and Torch Gaussian `f_dc_0..2` RGB drift checks in one report.

Validated locally:

```bash
./scripts/build_jazzy.sh
./scripts/verify_workspace.sh --skip-build --full-profiles
GAUSSIAN_LIC_ENABLE_TORCH=ON ./scripts/build_jazzy.sh --packages-select gaussian_lic_mapping
ros2 run gaussian_lic_mapping torch_backend_probe
./scripts/smoke_test.sh --bag bags/synthetic_gs_demo --torch --tf
./scripts/smoke_test.sh --bag bags/synthetic_gs_demo --composition --tf
```

Known limitations:

- Native Gaussian-LIC2 frontend/tracking is not ported yet.
- Full Gaussian rasterizer/optimizer/densification/pruning are not ported yet.
- `/gaussian_lic/rendered_image` currently uses `render_mode:=debug_cpu`, not the paper rasterizer.
- `/home/frank/data/fast_livo/` is empty on the current machine; strict FAST-LIVO2 baseline reproduction is blocked on data.
- TensorRT is not installed locally; depth completion remains optional.

Next concrete action:

```bash
docker pull ros:noetic-ros-base-focal
```

Then run the ROS1 upstream baseline on FAST-LIVO2 and archive outputs under:

```text
baseline/fastlivo2/<sequence>/
```
